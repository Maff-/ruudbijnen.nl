<p>Hi there, and welcome to my first 'true' blog. This is the place where I'll keep track of the progress I've made on some school assignments regarding <a title="openFrameworks" href="http://openframeworks.cc/" target="_blank">openFrameworks</a>.</p>
<p>In the near future this this blog's appearance will probably change a couple of times, as I'm still looking for a nice theme that supports the content I've intended to place here. Maybe I'll just create my own Theme from scratch, but for now this will do. (I guess).</p>
<p>Also I'm pretty new to WordPress, so I may need to look into it's features a bit more. But for now it's been a very nice and easy experience.</p>
<p>I'm intending to place some proper content here as soon as possible, so please visit again in some time.</p>
