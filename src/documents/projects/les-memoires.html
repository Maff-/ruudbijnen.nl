<p>Les Mémoires is an interactive and functional installation, that invites to stand still at the passage of time.</p>

<p>
	Together with fellow students we where asked to come up with a concept installation that tells the time to the users
	of the new building of the Saxion University of Applied Sciences (Enschede). We ended up with a video installation
	that will allow people to be part of time.
<p>
<p>
	A camera records the movement of the students, tutors and visitors and is displayed on a large screen.
	Every second a slice of the image will be frozen, and merged with the precious slices, adding up to a full minuteof time,
	60 slices of memory. This results in a unique memory of time, a representation of what happened that past minute.

	In this project I fulfilled the roles of Project Leader and Software Engineer. The software is written in C++
	(using <a title="openFrameworks, C++ toolkit for creative coding" href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a>).
