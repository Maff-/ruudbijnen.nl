The *Vereniging Branche-Opleidingsinstituten Gezondheidszorg* (VBG) commissioned a major update/rebuild of their website.

They wanted a fresh website that would be used for public information about the association as well as a private part
were members would be able to communicate with each other and work together in groups.

The custom build *CakePHP* web app features member, group, organization and content management as well as features for
its members. E.g. forums, calendars, photo albums.
