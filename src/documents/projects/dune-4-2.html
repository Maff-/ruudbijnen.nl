<p><blockquote>Dune 4.2 is a permanent interactive landscape besides the river Maas in Rotterdam, NL. This public artwork of 60 meters utilizes less than 60 Watt while intuitively interacting with the behavior of its visitors; rendering it a sustainable as well as cutting-edge concept.</blockquote></p>
<p>While my internship at Studio Roosegaarde I was assigned to research a new sensor for the permanent Dune installation which had to be robust and capable of withstanding all the aspects of the Dutch weather.</p>
