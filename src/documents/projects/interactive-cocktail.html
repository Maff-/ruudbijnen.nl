<p>Interactive Cocktail is a product to be used in bars and clubs, it's a subtle but entertaining way to promote a liquor brand.</p><!--more-->
<p>Interactive Cocktail consists of two parts, one being a bottle display that lights up the bottles it's holding in vivid colors. The other part is a cocktail shaker which senses its movement and behavior and lights up accordingly.</p>
<p>I've worked on this project during my internship at <a title="Visit the Studio Roosegaarde Website" href="http://studioroosegaarde.net/">Studio Roosegaarde</a>, where it was my job to research and develop a prototype. It involved the study of behavior detection from sensor input, wireless data communication protocols and writing software (C) for the micro controllers.</p>
