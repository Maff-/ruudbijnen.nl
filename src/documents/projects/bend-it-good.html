<p>Bend It Good! is a 'generative art' software piece that creates unique images for print, and is my contribution for the <a title="Written Images" href="http://writtenimages.net/">Written Images</a> project.</p>

<blockquote>Written Images; a project in contemporary generative print design and art. The final product will be a book that presents programmed images by various artists. Each print in process will be calculated individually – which makes every single book unique.</blockquote>

<p>It's written in C++ (using <a title="openFrameworks" href="http://openframeworks.net/">openFrameworks</a> and Cairo) to create high resolution images for print. It's a personal study to the generation of seamless aligning tiled images.</p>
